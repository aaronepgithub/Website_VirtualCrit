                <h4>Always Compete</h4>
                <p>Measure your performance against yourself and others 24/7, indoor and outdoor. A Sprint Crit is a 5 minute interval and a new one starts as soon as your last one ends. Daily totals are also broadcast throughout the ride.</p>
                <p>Your goal while riding will be to achieve and defend the #1 ranking on all the leaderboards.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Highest Sprint Criterium Effort Score</li>
                    <li>Fastest Sprint Criterium Average Speed</li>
                    <li>Highest Daily Effort Score</li>
                    <li>Fastest Daily Average Speed</li>
                </ol>
                <br>

                <h4>Effort Score</h4>
                <p>Scoring is based on your average heartrate as a percentage of your maximum heartrate. The Sprint Crit resets the average every 300 seconds - 5 minutes - while the daily Crit resets at the end of the day. This scoring model levels the playing field and allows for fair competition between riders wherever and whenever.</p>
                <p>It wouldn't be right if I didn't include a leaderboard for the fastest riders. I broadcast the fastest for each Sprint Crit along with those with the highest daily average speed. You will hear and see updates throughout the ride.</p>

                <h4>Built for Safe Riding</h4>
                <p>Keep your phone in your pocket while out on the road and just listen for essential updates to keep you in the game. The application will be broadcasting the names of the leaders to all riders.</p>

                <h4>No Overlap</h4>
                <p>This doesn't interfere with how I ride today and it is not intended to replace anything that you are currently doing. I still use my Garmin for real-time performance monitoring, I still upload my rides to Strava for analysis, and I still use Ride with GPS to get me where I am going. </p>
                    <p>It is very simple to Bluetooth-enable your Garmin ANT+ sensors using a Mio Velo or add Bluetooth + ANT sensors from Wahoo Fitness and others so you can participate. The application has been tested with sensors from a variety of different providers without any issues, if you encounter one, please send me an email with the make and model.</p>
