                <h4>Virtual Crit 3</h4>
                <p>Measure your performance against yourself and others 24/7, on real courses that you can design.</p>
                <p>Your goal while riding, running, or rowing will be to achieve and defend the #1 ranking on the leaderboards so others will fear you while attempting to defeat you.</p>

                <p>I just downloaded the app, how do I get started?</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                      You can just start the app and ride but that wouldn't be much fun.  So let's race.
                      <p>What do I do first?</p>
                      <p>You can create a Crit (race) using the Crit builder, or you can load a crit that someone else created by asking them for the CritID (what they named the Crit when they created it), or you can create a Crit gpx file (advanced).</p>
                      <p>The easist way would be to use the Crit Builder within the app.  You will click on map (long press on IOS) to create the start point, each checkpoint that the racer must pass over (minimum of 3), and the finish line.  The start point name will the CritID that you can share with others.  The names for the checkpoints are optional.  That's it, you are ready to race and share the CritID with others to join in.</p>

                      <p>If creating a GPX file to load, I would reccomend using Ride with GPS to build a route.  After you have built your route, add POI's along the route in the order that you want them to be raced.  Download the GPX file (GPX Track) and select the option to "Include POI's as Waypoints".  Make sure you name your Waypoints.</p>



                    </li>


                    <li>

                                        What is all the stuff in the app mean?
                                        <p>
                                          The app is designed to run while the phone is in your pocket and with the volume turned up so you can hear the audio cues.  The app will tell you when you arrived at the start, who the leader is, and where to go next.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>If you are looking at the app while riding (please stop and be safe about it, it is your responsibility to not get hurt).  You can look at your location along with the checkpoints on the map.  You can change the information on the settings page including your rider name along with the message that others will hear if you are the leader of the crit.  You can look at the dashboard with your speed and pace along with averages. Lastly, you can just keep the timeline on and that will show you the important information as it happens.</p>

                                        <p>Visible in the app is the "MTG".  The MTG is the "Meters To Go" until you reach your next checkpoint (and start/finish).  If you are biking (you change the sport in settings), you will need your MTG to be less that 150 to activate the next checkpoint.  If running, you need to be less than 100 and if rowing, you will need to be inside of 50 meters.</p>

                    </li>

                    
                </ol>

                <br>
                <br>
                <br>

                <!-- <h4>Effort Score</h4>
                <p>Scoring is based on your average heartrate as a percentage of your maximum heartrate. The Sprint Crit resets the average every interval (biking is set to 30 minutes, running and rowing are both set to 5 minute intervals) - while the daily Crit resets at the end of the day. This scoring model levels the playing field and allows for fair competition between athletes wherever and whenever.</p>
                <p>It wouldn't be right if I didn't include a leaderboard for the fastest. I broadcast the fastest for each Sprint Crit along with those with the highest daily average speed. You will hear and see updates throughout the competition.</p>

                <h4>Built for Safety</h4>
                <p>Keep your phone in your pocket and just listen for essential updates to keep you in the game. The application will be broadcasting the names of the leaders to all riders.</p>

                <h4>No Overlap</h4>
                <p>This doesn't interfere with how I train today and it is not intended to replace anything that you are currently doing. I still use my Garmin for real-time performance monitoring, I still upload my runs and rides to Strava for analysis, and I still use Ride with GPS to get me where I am going. </p>
                    <p>It is very simple to Bluetooth-enable your Garmin ANT+ sensors using a Mio Velo or add Bluetooth + ANT sensors from Wahoo Fitness and others so you can participate. The application has been tested with sensors from a variety of different providers without any issues, if you encounter one, please send me an email with the make and model.</p>
